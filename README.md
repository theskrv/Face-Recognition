# Face-Recognition
A simple python code for face detection and face recognition using Haarcascade Frontalface Algorithm.
First we create a folder named "Datasets".
We create these data sets for training our model in "face_detection.py".
Now. these datasets are used in "face_recognition.py" for our analysis.
